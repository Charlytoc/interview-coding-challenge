# Two Sum

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Example Inputs and Outputs

- Input: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`
  - Output: `[0, 1]`
  - Explanation: `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, so return `[0, 1]`.

- Input: `nums = [3, 2, 4]`, `target = 6`
  - Output: `[1, 2]`

- Input: `nums = [3, 3]`, `target = 6`
  - Output: `[0, 1]`

## Feeling Confident?

Make the solution be efficient, ideally with a time complexity of `O(n)`.
